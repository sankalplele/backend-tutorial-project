# Chai aur backend series

Here I will be creating my first backend project under the guidance of Histesh Choudhary Sir, following his "Chai aur Backend" playlist on his YouTube channel "Chai aur Code".

First Lecture

1. Basic Setup of the project like directories for example src, inside which we have middlewares, controllers, db etc. and .env files, .gitignore files to specify which need to be ignored by git.

2. Nodemon Dev Dependency is installed using "npm i -D nodemon" where 'D' represents devDependency

3. Prettier was installed and configured as a dev dependency which helps us write consistent code, if we are using different text editors or multiple people are working on the same project. We added .prettierrc and .prettierIgnore files to configure prettier and keep a track of which files need to be ignored by prettier for formatting, respectively.
